		<h5>Hey <abbr title ="Read on, rockstar">you</abbr>.</h5>
		<h6>Yes you.</h6>
		<h5>Let’s talk about<span style='color: purple;'> ~guerilla libraries~ </span></h5>

	<!--secondary hook-->
		<p><em><strong>First of all, what are they?</strong></em></p>
		<p>As a concept, guerilla libraries bring books and non-book materials together under the stewardship of people operating outside typical forms of authority and social mores.</p>
		<br />

		<p><em><strong>Okay, <span style="color:orange"> but really </span>, what are they?</strong></em></p>
		<p>	Some examples of guerilla libraries include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Library">The People’s Library</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/08/books-on-the-rail-the-guerrilla-library-infiltrating-melbournes-metro"> Books on the Rail</a>, and John Locke’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/nyregion/ny-designer-puts-lending-libraries-into-pay-phone-kiosks.html">NYC pay phone libraries</a> (no, not the philosopher). </p>	
		<br />

		<p><em><strong>That’s pretty cool!</strong></em></p>
		<p>We think so too. Do you want to learn more?</p>
		<p align="center"><strong><mark><abbr title="Free will to choose will be unlocked once I learn javascript ♪~ ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ">Y</abbr></mark>/<s>N</s></strong></p>
		<p align="right">...go on, young padawan</p>
		<p align="right"><span style="color: #FFFFFF">Notice the royal ‘we’ like I have some form of legit authority behind me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>
		<!--no line break b/c white text-->

		<p><em><strong>Woah, but don’t I need to be a <abbr title ="the real rockstars"><span style="color: green"> *librarian?* </span></abbr></strong></em></p>
		<p>Not necessarily, what you bring to your guerilla library is what you bring to it. Let your self flow, and do what you want.</p>
		<br />

		<p><em><strong>But... I don’t know what I want yet.</strong></em></p>
		<p align="right">...I know the feeling.</p>
		<p>Here are some questions you might want to ask yourself:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What resources do I have available to me?</li>
			<li>Do I want to source material from others, or will I be working with what I have?</li>
			<li>What are my goals and objectives?</li>
			<li>What statement am I making, and what kind of space do I want this to be?</li>
			<li>Does it even have to have a physical location?</li>
		</ul>
		<br />

		<p><em><strong>Okay, I have <sup>stuff</sup>. Now what?</strong></em></p>
		<p>Organize it? This isn’t me being a compulsive organiz00r – as you can probably intuit from the layout of this page – but you should think about how you’d like to present these materials to people.</p>
		<br />

		<p><em><strong>Seems like a lot of work. Why should I do this?</strong></em></p>
		<p align="center"><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><u>Because you probably like messing with things that</u></span></p>
		<p align="center"><span style="color: red"><u>YOU SHOULDN’T. DON’T BREAK THE RULES....</u></span></p>
		<p align="center"><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><u>Unless you're going to make something better.</u></span></p>
		<!--no line break b/c white text-->

		<p><em><strong>Nah, I want to do it because __________!</strong></em></p>
		<p>Bloody fantastic. _________________sounds like _____________. Cool stuff.</p>
		<br />

		<p><em><strong>Go do it. Go do it. Go do it. Good.</strong></em></p>
		<p align="center">You're on your own now.</p>
		<p align="center">Get cooking.</p>

		<h4>&lt;/psst&gt;</h4>
